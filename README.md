# MyGameEngine
This is a small perosnal project that i have developed in my first year of university.

The project consists of a small game engine developed using SFML library in C++.
## features

the engine is based around tiles and features:
- the possibility to customize the tiles used to build the levels
- level customization
- basic platform physics
### level customization
Levels are stored in a txt grid like format, each tile is associated to a character and a level is a single txt file with characters organized in a grid.
Look into the /Levels directory to see an example.
